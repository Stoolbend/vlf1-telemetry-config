# VLF1 Configs for Telemetry Tool
These configs are designed for use with Iko Rein's "Telemetry Tool" for F1 2021 and other games.

Their telemetry software can be downloaded here: <https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/telemetry-tool-for-f1-22.52172/>

These config files are designed to be put into the settings subfolder of the tool's data folder.
I believe by default, this is: `C:\Users\<username>\Telemetry_for_RaceSims\settings`

**driver_racenumber_map.csv** maps the race number of cars in MP lobbies to VL F1 driver names & TLA's, although the TLA part does not seem to work currently.
